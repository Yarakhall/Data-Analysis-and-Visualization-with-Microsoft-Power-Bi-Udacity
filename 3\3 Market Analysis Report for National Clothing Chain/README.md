# **Market Analysis Report for National Clothing Chain**

Project of Udacity's [Data Analysis and Visualization with Microsoft Power BI Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analysis-and-visualization-with-power-BI-nanodegree--nd331)
in **Advanced Data Analysis with Power BI** course.

## Project Overview:
An online national clothing chain needs your help creating a targeted marketing campaign. Sales have been flat and they want to lure lost customers back. They want to advertise specific products to specific customers in specific locations, but they don’t know who to target. They have three products in mind:
Shirt: $25
Sweater: $100
Leather Bag: $1,000
They need you to conduct an analysis to determine the best product to advertise to each customer.

### Project Instructions:
In this project, you will use population statistics from the US Census Bureau to determine where the greatest income exists around the country and whether there is a correlation between sales and income. We don’t know the incomes of our customers, but we should be able to predict it by looking at their purchase history and locations and comparing that against the census data. Additionally, we want to analyze our inventory, specifically customer ratings and return rate and see if there’s a correlation between the two.


### Draw conclusions:
Draw conclusions from your analysis and use visuals to answer the following questions:
Analysis Questions:
  - What is the correlation (R2 value) between sales and income?
  - What is the correlation (R2 value) between customer ratings and product return rate?
  - What are the linear regression formulas to predict customer income from customer sales?
  - Which customer do you predict has the highest income?
  - Which product will be advertised the most?

### Present your analysis:
You’ll need to present your analysis as a 1 page written summary and visual report in Power BI. Use the following visuals to present your data:
  - Income Distribution: Histogram
  - Household Income by Location: Map
  - Correlations: Scatter Plot with Trendline and Card with R^2 value
Use other visuals as-needed to further present the results of your analysis.

### Detailed Instructions:
1. Import the census data, customer list, purchase list, and state list into Power BI. You’ll use the “Get Data” button to start the import process. Make sure you select each of the available tables within each Excel file. There should be 7 total tables:
 - Avg Income by State
 - Customer List
 - Incomes by State
 - Industries
 - Product Inventory
 - Purchase List
 - State List
2. Set up the data in Power Query so that all the columns are correctly formatted and structured. Some of the tables will require steps in Power Query to be correctly set up.
3. Set up your table relationships. All tables you import should be tied into the table relationships (if possible). Avoid many-to-many relationships as they’re not needed and will cause issues with cross-filtering.
4. Review the table relationships and confirm if they are properly set up. Most of the tables should follow a star schema.
